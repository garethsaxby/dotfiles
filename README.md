# Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. I will be using [garethsaxby/workspace-setup](https://github.com/garethsaxby/workspace-setup) to install these.

These files (should!) all be sanitised and ready for others to grab contents from, if you feel so inclined.

All files are named without dots, as the intention is that within the repository they should remain visible, and will be symbolically linked to their dotfile locations in my home directory. Also, I don't want them to conflict with dotfiles inside this repository.
